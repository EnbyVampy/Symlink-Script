# Symlink-Script
just a simple script to automate creating a symbolic link between two given files/folders
Usage is simple, just run as admin and a prompt will pop up for you to browse to the file
or folder you wish to create a link to (the source) then the next box will have you navigate
to where you want the symlink to link to. Then the prompt will ask you what you want to name
the symlink.
